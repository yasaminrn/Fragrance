As a fragrance lover, herein, I have performed a comprehensive data analysis of the fragrance database from https://www.kaggle.com/hadihojjati/perfume-preprocess.

Some preprocessing of the data was performed in the above mentioned kaggle page. More data processing are performed in this project to extract the parameters required for this study.

Further analysis included in this project includes:

1-Exploratory Data Analyis, Data Processing, and Data Visualization (to observe the trends)
2-K Mean Clustring (to group the perfumes based on their performance)
3-Linear Regression (to finad the relationships between ratings score and fragrance performance)

The project is ongoing, as there are multiple trends and patterns to explore among the data. The next phase of study would be using notes and accords of the fragrance as basis for a recommendation system.
